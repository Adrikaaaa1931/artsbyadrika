            <p> Adrika Bordoloi's meteoric rise as a painter has been almost without parallel. <br/>
                She is at the pinnacle of an extraordinary career and is considered by many to be the<br/>
                foremost painter in her state. She was brought in Assam, moved to UAe and studied contemporary art at School of Art.<br/>
                 Her artistic talent was soon recognised, receiving the highly acclaimed Biddulph Painting Scholarship.<br/><br/>

                Today, Adrika lives Abu Dhabi.From these inspirational surroundings, <br/>
                Adrika continues to work on numerous prestigious commissions and <br/>
                has an extensive list of international, public and private collectors.<br/><br/>
                
                Adrika's use of imaginative composition, vibrant colour and unusual surfaces which include sheets of gold <br/>
                and silver leaf, help to further emphasise her skilled draughtsmanship and thorough knowledge of wildlife anatomy</p>
